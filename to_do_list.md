## Take Out the Test Modules


add confirmation to ensure that the appointment has been successfully created and deleted (instead of str, return boolean)

change change_status (appointments) return to bool

appointment class change_date_time method need to be modified

appointment class change_doctor method has to ensure that doctor is available at that time

appointment class change_patient method does not really make sense, does it? Maybe we should take it off

appointment class change_room has to ensure that room is available
